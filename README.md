# MathAlgorithms

This is just a simple Android Application to demonstrate some algorithms to use in my discrete mathematics class.  This will be added to throughout the term.

### Algorithms so far implemented:
* GCD (using Euclid's Algorithm
* LCM (using LCM = a * b / GCD(a, b)
* Prime Factorization (using simple, inefficient algoirthm)
